#Contributing to AuTe Framework

## Issues and Bugs
If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by [submitting a ticket](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-an-issue) to our GitHub issues. Even better, you can submit a Pull Request to our AuTe Framework project.

**Please see the Submission Guidelines below**.
## Feature Requests
You can request a new feature by submitting a ticket to our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues). If you
would like to implement a new feature then consider what kind of change it is:

* **Major Changes** that you wish to contribute to the project should be discussed first. Please open a ticket which clearly states that it is a feature request in the title and explain clearly what you want to achieve in the description, and the JHipster team will discuss with you what should be done in that ticket. You can then start working on a Pull Request.
* **Small Changes** can be proposed without any discussion. Open up a ticket which clearly states that it is a feature request in the title. Explain your change in the description, and you can propose a Pull Request straight away.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and has not been reported, open a new issue.
Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  Providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **Overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a stack trace helps
* **Motivation for or Use Case** - explain why this is a bug for you
* **Reproduce the error** - an unambiguous set of steps to reproduce the error
* **Related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **Suggest a Fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be causing the problem (line of code or commit)
* **AuTe Framework Version(s)** - is it a regression?
* **AuTe Framework configuration, a `evn.yml` file in the root folder** - this will help us to find out configuration problems (you can remove logins and passwords).
* **AuTe Framework scenarios(s) folder `scenarios folder`** - if the error is during scenario execution it can help us to identify problem
* **Browsers and Operating System** - is this a problem with all browsers?
